Algorithm Description
\end{center}

\paragraph{}
My algorithm for the Knight's Tour problem uses Depth First Search (DFS) using Warnsdorf's rule as a heuristic. Depth first search
uses a stack that pushes possible moves onto the stack in order from lowest priority to highest. Priority is determined using
Warnsdorf's rule. The next move is decided by how many moves the next knight could take. The next knight that can take the fewest
future moves is added onto the stack last.

Pseudo Code

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Pseudo Code}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Knight's Tour}{}
\State board = initial board \
\State stack.push(board) \
\State Solved = false \
\While{Solved = false}
	\State board $\gets$ stack.pop() \
	\If{board is Solved} \
		\State Quit Loop \
	\EndIf
	\State states $\gets$ board.moves() \
	\State orderedStates $\gets$ states.order() \
	\State stack.push(orderedStates) \
\EndWhile
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Complexity
\end{center}

\paragraph{}
The worst possible case for this algorithm is $O(8^{n^2-1})$. This is because, for every possible node, 8 moves have to be checked. Since I am using DFS, $n^2-1$ nodes may be generated, where n is the size of the board.
